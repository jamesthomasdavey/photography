          I can’t sleep, but when I’m sure my wife Vicky is asleep, I get up and
          look through our bedroom window, across the street, at Oliver and
          Amanda’s house. Oliver has been gone for three days, but his wife
          Amanda is awake. She can’t sleep either. It’s four in the morning, and
          there’s not a sound outside—no wind, no cars, no moon even—just Oliver
          and Amanda’s place with the lights on, leaves heaped up under the
          front windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          A couple of days ago, when I couldn’t sit still, I raked our yard—
          Vicky’s and mine. I gathered all the leaves into bags, tied off the
          tops, and put the bags alongside the curb. I had an urge then to cross
          the street and rake over there, but I didn’t follow through. It’s my
          fault things are the way they are across the street.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve only slept a few hours since Oliver left. Vicky saw me moping
          around the house, looking anxious, and decided to put two and two
          together. She’s on her side of the bed now, scrunched on to about ten
          inches of mattress. She got into bed and tried to position herself so
          she wouldn’t accidentally roll into me while she slept. She hasn’t
          moved since she lay down, sobbed, and then dropped into sleep. She’s
          exhausted. I’m exhausted too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve taken nearly all of Vicky’s pills, but I still can’t sleep. I’m
          keyed up. But maybe if I keep looking I’ll catch a glimpse of Amanda
          moving around inside her house, or else find her peering from behind a
          curtain, trying to see what she can see over here.
        </p>
        <p>What if I do see her? So what? What then?</p>
        <p>
          Vicky says I’m crazy. She said worse things too last night. But who
          could blame her? I told her—I had to—but I didn’t tell her it was
          Amanda. When Amanda’s name came up, I insisted it wasn’t her. Vicky
          suspects, but I wouldn’t name names. I wouldn’t say who, even though
          she kept pressing and then hit me a few times in the head.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What’s it matter who?” I said. “You’ve never met the woman,” I lied.
          “You don’t know her.” That’s when she started hitting me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel wired. That’s what my painter friend Alfredo used to call it
          when he talked about friends of his coming down off something. Wired.
          I’m wired.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thing is nuts. I know it is, but I can’t stop thinking about
          Amanda. Things are so bad just now I even find myself thinking about
          my first wife, Molly. I loved Molly, I thought, more than my own life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I keep picturing Amanda in her pink nightgown, the one I like on her
          so much, along with her pink slippers. And I feel certain she’s in the
          big leather chair right now, under the brass reading lamp. She’s
          smoking cigarettes, one after the other. There are two ashtrays close
          at hand, and they’re both full. To the left of her chair, next to the
          lamp, there’s an end table stacked with magazines—the usual magazines
          that nice people read. We’re nice people, all of us, to a point. Right
          this minute, Amanda is, I imagine, paging through a magazine, stopping
          every so often to look at an illustration or a cartoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two days ago, in the afternoon, Amanda said to me, “I can’t read books
          any more. Who has the time?” It was the day after Oliver had left, and
          we were in this little cafe in the industrial part of the city. “Who
          can concentrate anymore?” she said, stirring her coffee. “Who reads?
          Do you read?” (I shook my head.)
        </p>
        <p>
          “Somebody must read, I guess. You see all these books around in store
          windows, and there are those clubs. Somebody’s reading,” she said.
          “Who? I don’t know anybody who reads.”
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s what she said, apropos of nothing—that is, we weren’t talking
          about books, we were talking about our lives. Books had nothing to do
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>“What did Oliver say when you told him?”</p>
        <p>
          Then it struck me that what we were saying—the tense, watchful
          expressions we wore—belonged to the people on afternoon TV programs
          that I’d never done more than switch on and then off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amanda looked down and shook her head, as if she couldn’t bear to
          remember.
        </p>
        <p>“You didn’t admit who it was you were involved with, did you?”</p>
        <p>She shook her head again.</p>
        <p>
          “You’re sure of that?” I waited until she looked up from her coffee.
          “I didn’t mention any names, if that’s what you mean.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Did he say where he was going, or how long he’d be away?” I said,
          wishing I didn’t have to hear myself. This was my neighbor I was
          talking about. Oliver Porter. A man I’d helped drive out of his home.
        </p>
        <p>
          “He didn’t say where. A hotel. He said I should make my arrangements
          and be gone—be gone, he said. It was like biblical the way he said
          it—out of his house, out of his life, in a week’s time. I guess he’s
          coming back then. So we have to decide something real important, real
          soon, honey. You and I have to make up our minds pretty damn quick.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It was her turn to look at me now, and I know she was looking for a
          sign of life-long commitment. “A week,” I said. I looked at my coffee,
          which had gotten cold. A lot had happened in a little while, and we
          were trying to take it in. I don’t know what long-term things, if any,
          we’d thought about those months as we moved from flirtation to love,
          and then afternoon assignations. In any case, we were in a serious fix
          now. Very serious. We’d never expected—not in a hundred years—to be
          hiding out in a cafe, in the middle of the afternoon, trying to decide
          matters like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my eyes, and Amanda began stirring her coffee. She kept
          stirring it. I touched her hand, and the spoon dropped out of her
          fingers. She picked it up and began stirring again. We could have been
          anybody drinking coffee at a table under fluorescent lights in a
          run-down cafe. Anybody, just about. I took Amanda’s hand and held it,
          and it seemed to make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vicky’s still sleeping on her side when I go downstairs. I plan to
          heat some milk and drink that. I used to drink whiskey when I couldn’t
          sleep, but I gave it up. Now it’s strictly hot milk. In the whiskey
          days I’d wake up with this tremendous thirst in the middle of the
          night. But, back then, I was always looking ahead: I kept a bottle of
          water in the fridge, for instance. I’d be dehydrated, sweating from
          head to toe when I woke, but I’d wander out to the kitchen and could
          count on finding that bottle of cold water in the fridge. I’d drink
          it, all of it, down the hatch, an entire quart of water. Once in a
          while I’d use a glass, but not often. Suddenly I’d be drunk all over
          again and weaving around the kitchen. I can’t begin to account for
          it—sober one minute, drunk the next.
        </p>
        <p>
          The drinking was part of my destiny—according to Molly, anyway. She
          put a lot of stock in destiny.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel wild from lack of sleep. I’d give anything, just about, to be
          able to go to sleep, and sleep the sleep of an honest man. Why do we
          have to sleep anyway? And why do we tend to sleep less during some
          crises and more during others? For instance, that time my dad had his
          stroke. He woke up after a coma-seven days and nights in a hospital
          bed—and calmly said “Hello” to the people in his room. Then his eyes
          picked me out. “Hello, son,” he said. Five minutes later, he died.
          Just like that—he died. But, during that whole crisis, I never took my
          clothes off and didn’t go to bed. I may have catnapped in a
          waiting-room chair from time to time, but I never went to bed and
          slept.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then a year or so ago I found out Vicky was seeing somebody else.
          Instead of confronting her, I went to bed when I heard about it, and
          stayed there. I didn’t get up for days, a week maybe—I don’t know. I
          mean, I got up to go to the bathroom, or else to the kitchen to make a
          sandwich. I even went out to the living room in my pajamas, in the
          afternoon, and tried to read the papers. But I’d fall asleep sitting
          up. Then I’d stir, open my eyes and go back to bed and sleep some
          more. I couldn’t get enough sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          It passed. We weathered it. Vicky quit her boyfriend, or he quit her,
          I never found out. I just know she went away from me for a while, and
          then she came back. But I have the feeling we’re not going to weather
          this business. This thing is different. Oliver has given Amanda that
          ultimatum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, isn’t it possible that Oliver himself is awake at this moment
          and writing a letter to Amanda, urging reconciliation? Even now he
          might be scribbling away, trying to persuade her that what she’s doing
          to him and their daughter Beth is foolish, disastrous, and finally a
          tragic thing for the three of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, that’s insane. I know Oliver. He’s relentless, unforgiving. He
          could slam a croquet ball into the next block—and has. He isn’t going
          to write any such letter. He gave her an ultimatum, right?—and that’s
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          A week. Four days now. Or is it three? Oliver may be awake, but if he
          is, he’s sitting in a chair in his hotel room with a glass of iced
          vodka in his hand, his feet on the bed, TV turned on low. He’s
          dressed, except for his shoes. He’s not wearing shoes—that’s the only
          concession he makes. That and the fact he’s loosened his tie.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver is relentless.</p>
        <p>
          I heat the milk, spoon the skin from the surface and pour it up. Then
          I turn off the kitchen light and take the cup into the living room and
          sit on the sofa, where I can look across the street at the lighted
          windows. But I can hardly sit still. I keep fidgeting, crossing one
          leg and then the other. I feel like I could throw off sparks, or break
          a window-maybe rearrange all the furniture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The things that go through your mind when you can’t sleep! Earlier,
          thinking about Molly, for a moment I couldn’t even remember what she
          looked like, for Christ’s sake, yet we were together for years, more
          or less continuously, since we were kids. Molly, who said she’d love
          me forever. The only thing left was the memory of her sitting and
          weeping at the kitchen table, her shoulders bent forward, and her
          hands covering her face. Forever, she said. But it hadn’t worked out
          that way. Finally, she said, it didn’t matter, it was of no real
          concern to her, if she and I lived together the rest of our lives or
          not. Our love existed on a “higher plane.” That’s what she said to
          Vicky over the phone that time, after Vicky and I had set up
          housekeeping together. Molly called, got hold of Vicky, and said, “You
          have your relationship with him, but I’ll always have mine. His
          destiny and mine are linked.”
        </p>
        <p>
          My first wife, Molly, she talked like that. “Our destinies are
          linked.” She didn’t talk like that in the beginning. It was only
          later, after so much had happened, that she started using words like
          “cosmic” and “empowerment” and so forth. But our destinies are not
          linked—not now, anyway, if they ever were. I don’t even know where she
          is now, not for certain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I could put my finger on the exact time, the real turning
          point, when it came undone for Molly. It was after I started seeing
          Vicky, and Molly found out. They called me up one day from the high
          school where Molly taught and said, “Please. Your wife is doing
          handsprings in front of the school. You’d better get down here.” It
          was after I took her home that I began hearing about “higher power”
          and “going with the flow”— stuff of that sort. Our destiny had been
          “revised.” And if I’d been hesitating before, well, I left her then as
          fast as I could—this woman I’d known all my life, the one who’d been
          my best friend for years, my intimate, my confidante. I bailed out on
          her. For one thing, I was scared. Scared.
        </p>
        <p>
          This girl I’d started out with in life, this sweet thing, this gentle
          soul, she wound up going to fortunetellers, palm readers, crystal ball
          gazers, looking for answers, trying to figure out what she should do
          with her life. She quit her job, drew out her teacher’s retirement
          money, and thereafter never made a decision without consulting the I
          Ching. She began wearing strange clothes—clothes with permanent
          wrinkles and a lot of burgundy and orange. She even got involved with
          a group that sat around, I’m not kidding, trying to levitate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Molly and I were growing up together, she was a part of me and,
          sure, I was a part of her, too. We loved each other. It was our
          destiny. I believed in it then myself. But now I don’t know what to
          believe in. I’m not complaining, simply stating a fact. I’m down to
          nothing. And I have to go on like this. No destiny. Just the next
          thing meaning whatever you think it does. Compulsion and error, just
          like everybody else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amanda? I’d like to believe in her, bless her heart. But she was
          looking for somebody when she met me.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s the way with people when they get restless: they start up
          something, knowing that’s going to change things for good.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d like to go out in the front yard and shout something. “None of
          this is worth it!” That’s what I’d like people to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Destiny,” Molly said. For all I know she’s still talking about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the lights are off over there now, except for that light in the
          kitchen. I could try calling Amanda on the phone. I could do that and
          see how far it gets me! What if Vicky heard me dialing or talking on
          the phone and came downstairs? What if she lifted the receiver
          upstairs and listened? Besides, there’s always the chance Beth might
          pick up the phone. I don’t want to talk to any kids this morning. I
          don’t want to talk to anybody. Actually, I’d talk to Molly, if I
          could, but I can’t any longer—she’s somebody else now. She isn’t Molly
          anymore. But—what can I say?—I’m somebody else, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish I could be like everybody else in this neighborhood—your basic,
          normal, unaccomplished person-and go up to my bedroom, and lie down,
          and sleep. It’s going to be a big day today, and I’d like to be ready
          for it. I wish I could sleep and wake up and find everything in my
          life different. Not necessarily just the big things, like this thing
          with Amanda or the past with Molly. But things clearly within my
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the situation with my mother: I used to send money every month.
          But then I started sending her the same amount in twice-yearly sums. I
          gave her money on her birthday, and I gave her money at Christmas. I
          thought: I won’t have to worry about forgetting her birthday, and I
          won’t have to worry about sending her a Christmas present. I won’t
          have to worry, period. It went like clockwork for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then last year she asked me—it was in between money times, it was in
          March, or maybe April—for a radio. A radio, she said, would make a
          difference to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          What she wanted was a little clock radio. She could put it in her
          kitchen and have it out there to listen to while she was fixing
          something to eat in the evening. And she’d have the clock to look at
          too, so she’d know when something was supposed to come out of the
          oven, or how long it was until one of her programs started.
        </p>
        <p>A little clock radio.</p>
        <p>
          She hinted around at first. She said, “I’d sure like to have a radio.
          But I can’t afford one. I guess I’ll have to wait for my birthday.
          That little radio I had, it fell and broke. I miss a radio.” I miss a
          radio. That’s what she said when we talked on the phone, or else she’d
          bring it up when she’d write.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally—what’d I say? I said to her over the phone that I couldn’t
          afford any radios. I said it in a letter too, so she’d be sure and
          understand. I can’t afford any radios, is what I wrote. I can’t do
          anymore, I said, than I’m doing. Those were my very words.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it wasn’t true! I could have done more. I just said I couldn’t. I
          could have afforded to buy a radio for her. What would it have cost
          me? Thirty-five dollars? Forty dollars or less, including tax. I could
          have sent her a radio through the mail. I could have had somebody in
          the store do it, if I didn’t want to go to the trouble myself. Or else
          I could have sent her a forty-dollar check along with a note saying,
          This money is for your radio, mother. I could have handled it in any
          case. Forty dollars—are you kidding? But I didn’t. I wouldn’t part
          with it. It seemed there was a principle involved. That’s what I told
          myself anyway—there’s a principle involved here.
        </p>
        <p>Ha.</p>
        <p>
          Then what happened? She died. She died. She was walking home from the
          grocery store, back to her apartment, carrying her sack of groceries,
          and she fell into somebody’s bushes and died.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a flight out there to make the arrangements. She was still at
          the coroner’s, and they had her purse and her groceries behind the
          desk in the office. I didn’t bother to look in the purse they handed
          me. But what
        </p>

          she had from the grocery store was a jar of Metamucil, two
          grapefruits, a carton of cottage cheese, a quart of buttermilk, some
          potatoes and onions, and a package of ground meat that was beginning
          to change color. Boy! I cried when I saw those things. I couldn’t
          stop. I didn’t think I’d ever quit crying. The woman who worked at the
          desk was embarrassed and brought me a glass of water. They gave me a
          bag for my mother’s groceries and another bag for her personal
          effects—her purse and her dentures. Later, I put the dentures in my
          coat pocket and drove them down in a rental car and gave them to
          somebody at the funeral home.

          The light in Amanda’s kitchen is still on. It’s a bright light that
          spills out on to all those leaves. Maybe she’s like I am, and she’s
          scared. Maybe she left that light burning as a night-light. Or maybe
          she’s still awake and is at the kitchen table, under the light,
          writing me a letter. Amanda is writing me a letter, and somehow she’ll
          get it into my hands later on when the real day starts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Come to think of it, I’ve never had a letter from her since we’ve
          known each other. All the time we’ve been involved—six months, eight
          months—and I’ve never once seen a scrap of her handwriting. I don’t
          even know if she’s literate that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think she is. Sure, she is. She talks about books, doesn’t she? It
          doesn’t matter of course. Well, a little, I suppose. I love her in any
          case, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          But I’ve never written anything to her, either. We always talked on
          the phone or else face to face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Molly, she was the letter writer. She used to write me even after we
          weren’t living together. Vicky would bring her letters in from the box
          and leave them on the kitchen table without a word. Finally the
          letters dwindled away, became more and more infrequent and bizarre.
          When she did write, the letters gave me a chill. They were full of
          talk about “auras” and “signs.” Occasionally she reported a voice that
          was telling her something she ought to do or some place she should go.
          And once she told me that no matter what happened, we were still “on
          the same frequency.” She always knew exactly what I felt, she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          She “beamed in on me,” she said, from time to time. Reading those
          letters of hers, the hair on the back of my neck would tingle. She
          also had a new word for destiny: Karma. “I’m following out my karma,”
          she wrote. “Your karma has taken a bad turn.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d like to go to sleep, but what’s the point? People will be getting
          up soon. Vicky’s alarm will go off before much longer. I wish I could
          go upstairs and get back in bed with my wife, tell her I’m sorry,
          there’s been a mistake, let’s forget all this-then go to sleep and
          wake up with her in my arms. But I’ve forfeited that right. I’m
          outside all that now, and I can’t get back inside! But say I did that.
          Say I went upstairs and slid into bed with Vicky as I’d like to do.
          She might wake up and say, You bastard. Don’t you dare touch me, son
          of a bitch.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s she talking about, anyway? I wouldn’t touch her. Not in that
          way, I wouldn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I left Molly, after I’d pulled out on her, about two months
          after, then Molly really did it. She had her real collapse then, the
          one that’d been coming on. Her sister saw to it that she got the care
          she needed. What am I saying? They put her away. They had to, they
          said. They put my wife away. By then I was living with Vicky, and
          trying not to drink whiskey. I couldn’t do anything for Molly. I mean,
          she was there, I was here, and I couldn’t have gotten her out of that
          place if I’d wanted to. But the fact is, I didn’t want to. She was in
          there, they said, because she needed to be in there. Nobody said
          anything about destiny. Things had gone beyond that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I didn’t even go visit her—not once! At the time, I didn’t think I
          could stand seeing her in there. But, Christ, what was I? A
          fair-weather friend? We’d been through plenty. But what on earth would
          I have said to her? I’m sorry about all this, honey. I could have said
          that, I guess. I intended to write, but I didn’t. Not a word. Anyway,
          when you get right down to it, what could I have said in a letter? How
          are they treating you, baby? I’m sorry you’re where you are, but don’t
          give up. Remember all the good times? Remember when we were happy
          together? Hey, I’m sorry they’ve done this to you. I’m sorry it turned
          out this way. I’m sorry everything is just garbage now. I’m sorry,
          Molly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t write. I think I was trying to forget about her, to pretend
          she didn’t exist. Molly who?
        </p>
        <p>
          I left my wife and took somebody else’s: Vicky. Now I think maybe I’ve
          lost Vicky, too. But Vicky won’t be going away to any summer camp for
          the mentally disabled. She’s a hard case. She left her former husband,
          Joe Kraft, and didn’t bat an eye; I don’t think she ever lost a
          night’s sleep over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vicky Kraft-Hughes. Amanda Porter. This is where my destiny has
          brought me? To this street in this neighborhood, messing up the lives
          of these women?
        </p>
        <p>
          Amanda’s kitchen light went off when I wasn’t looking. The room that
          was there is gone now, like the others. Only the porch light is still
          burning. Amanda must have forgotten it, I guess. Hey, Amanda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once, when Molly was away in that place and I wasn’t in my right
          mind—let’s face it, I was crazy too-one night I was at my friend
          Alfredo’s house, a bunch of us drinking and listening to records. I
          didn’t care any longer what happened to me. Everything, I thought,
          that could happen had happened. I felt unbalanced. I felt lost.
          Anyway, there I was at Alfredo’s. His paintings of tropical birds and
          animals hung on every wall in his house, and there were paintings
          standing around in the rooms, leaning against things—table-legs, say,
          or his brick- and-board bookcase, as well as being stacked on his back
          porch. The kitchen served as his studio, and I was sitting at the
          kitchen table with a drink in front of me. An easel stood off to one
          side in front of the window that overlooked the alley, and there were
          crumpled tubes of paint, a palette, and some brushes lying at one end
          of the table. Alfredo was making himself a drink at the counter a few
          feet away. I loved the shabby economy of that little room. The stereo
          music that came from the living room was turned up, filling the house
          with so much sound the kitchen windows rattled in their frames.
          Suddenly I began to shake. First my hands began to shake, and then my
          arms and shoulders, too. My teeth started to chatter. I couldn’t hold
          the glass.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What’s going on, man?” Alfredo said, when he turned and saw the state
          I was in. “Hey, what is it?
        </p>
        <p>What’s going on with you?”</p>
        <p>
          I couldn’t tell him. What could I say? I thought I was having some
          kind of an attack. I managed to raise my shoulders and let them drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Alfredo came over, took a chair and sat down beside me at the
          kitchen table. He put his big painter’s hand on my shoulder. I went on
          shaking. He could feel me shaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What’s wrong with you, man? I’m real sorry about everything, man. I
          know it’s real hard right now.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he said he was going to fix menudo for me. He said it would be
          good for what ailed me. “Help your nerves, man,” he said. “Calm you
          right down.” He had all the ingredients for menudo, he said, and he’d
          been wanting to make some anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          “You listen to me. Listen to what I say, man. I’m your family now,”
          Alfredo said.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was two in the morning, we were drunk, there were these other drunk
          people in the house and the stereo was going full blast. But Alfredo
          went to his fridge and opened it and took some stuff out. He closed
          the fridge door and looked in his freezer compartment. He found
          something in a package. Then he looked around in his cupboards. He
          took a big pan from the cabinet under the sink, and he was ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tripe. He started with tripe and about a gallon of water. Then he
          chopped onions and added them to the water, which had started to boil.
          He put chorizo sausage in the pot. After that, he dropped peppercorns
          into the boiling water and sprinkled in some chili powder. Then came
          the olive oil. He opened a big can of tomato sauce and poured that in.
          He added cloves of garlic, some slices of white bread, salt, and lemon
          juice. He opened another can—it was hominy—and poured that in the pot,
          too. He put it all in, and then he turned the heat down and put a lid
          on the pot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched him. I sat there shaking while Alfredo stood at the stove
          making menudo, talking—I didn’t have any idea what he was saying—and,
          from time to time, he’d shake his head, or else start whistling to
          himself. Now and then people drifted into the kitchen for beer. But
          all the while Alfredo went on very seriously looking after his menudo.
          He could have been home, in Morelia, making menudo for his family on
          New Year’s day. People hung around in the kitchen for a while, joking,
          but Alfredo didn’t joke back when they kidded him about cooking menudo
          in the middle of the night. Pretty soon they left us alone. Finally,
          while Alfredo stood at the stove with a spoon in his hand, watching
          me, I got up slowly from the table. I walked out of the kitchen into
          the bathroom, and then opened another door off the bathroom to the
          spare room—where I lay down on the bed and fell asleep. When I woke it
          was midafternoon. The menudo was gone. The pot was in the sink,
          soaking. Those other people must have eaten it! They must have eaten
          it and grown calm. Everyone was gone, and the house was quiet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never saw Alfredo more than once or twice afterward. After that
          night, our lives took us in separate directions. And those other
          people who were there—who knows where they went? I’ll probably die
          without ever tasting menudo. But who can say?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this what it all comes down to then? A middle-aged man involved
          with his neighbor’s wife, linked to an angry ultimatum? What kind of
          destiny is that? A week, Oliver said. Three or four days now.
        </p>
        <p>
          A car passes outside with its lights on. The sky is turning gray, and
          I hear some birds starting up. I decide I can’t wait any longer. I
          can’t just sit here, doing nothing—that’s all there is to it. I can’t
          keep waiting. I’ve waited and waited and where’s it gotten me? Vicky’s
          alarm will go off soon, Beth will get up and dress for school, Amanda
          will wake up, too. The entire neighborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the back porch I find some old jeans and a sweatshirt, and I change
          out of my pajamas. Then I put on my white canvas shoes—”wino” shoes,
          Alfredo would have called them. Alfredo, where are you?
        </p>
        <p>
          I go outside to the garage and find the rake and some lawn bags. By
          the time I get around to the front of the house with the rake, ready
          to begin, I feel I don’t have a choice in the matter any longer. It’s
          light out—light enough at any rate for what I have to do. And then,
          without thinking about it any more, I start to rake. I rake our yard,
          every inch of it. It’s important it be done right, too. I set the rake
          right down into the turf and pull hard. It must feel to the grass like
          it does whenever someone gives your hair a hard jerk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now and then a car passes in the street and slows, but I don’t look up
          from my work. I know what the people in the cars must be thinking, but
          they’re dead wrong—they don’t know the half of it. How could they? I’m
          happy, raking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I finish our yard and put the bag out next to the curb. Then I begin
          next door on the Baxters’ yard. In a few minutes Mrs. Baxter comes out
          on her porch, wearing her bathrobe. I don’t acknowledge her. I’m not
          embarrassed, and I don’t want to appear unfriendly. I just want to
          keep on with what I’m doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          She doesn’t say anything for a while, and then she says, “Good
          morning, Mr. Hughes. How are you this morning?”
        </p>
        <p>
          I stop what I’m doing and run my arm across my forehead. “I’ll be
          through in a little while,” I say. “I hope you don’t mind.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “We don’t mind,” Mrs. Baxter says. “Go right ahead, I guess.” I see
          Mr. Baxter standing in the doorway behind her. He’s already dressed
          for work in his slacks and sports coat and tie. But he doesn’t venture
          on to the porch. Then Mrs. Baxter turns and looks at Mr. Baxter, who
          shrugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s okay, I’ve finished here anyway. There are other yards, more
          important yards for that matter. I kneel, and, taking a grip low down
          on the rake handle, I pull the last of the leaves into my bag and tie
          off the top. Then, I can’t help it, I just stay there, kneeling on the
          grass with the rake in my hand. When I look up, I see the Baxters come
          down the porch steps together and move slowly toward me through the
          wet, sweet-smelling grass. They stop a few feet away and look at me
          closely.
        </p>
        <p>
          “There now,” I hear Mrs. Baxter say. She’s still in her robe and
          slippers. It’s nippy out; she holds her robe at the throat. “You did a
          real fine job for us, yes, you did.”
        </p>
        <p>I don’t say anything. I don’t even say, “You’re welcome.”</p>
        <p>
          They stand in front of me a while longer, and none of us says anything
          more. It’s as if we’ve come to an agreement on something. In a minute,
          they turn around and go back to their house. High over my head, in the
          branches of the old maple—the place where these leaves come from—
          birds call out to each other.
        </p>
        <p>At least I think they’re calling to each other.</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly a car door slams. Mr. Baxter is in his car in the drive with
          the window rolled down. Mrs. Baxter says something to him from the
          front porch which causes Mr. Baxter to nod slowly and turn his head in
          my direction. He sees me kneeling there with the rake, and a look
          crosses his face. He frowns. In his better moments, Mr. Baxter is a
          decent, ordinary guy—a guy you wouldn’t mistake for anyone special.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he is special. In my book, he is. For one thing he has a full
          night’s sleep behind him, and he’s just embraced his wife before
          leaving for work. But even before he goes, he’s already expected home
          a set number of hours later. True, in the grander scheme of things,
          his return will be an event of small moment—but an event nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Baxter starts his car and races the engine. Then he backs effortlessly
          out of the drive, brakes, and changes gears. As he passes on the
          street, he slows and looks briefly in my direction. He lifts his hand
          off the steering wheel. It could be a salute or a sign of dismissal.
          It’s a sign, in any case. And then he looks away toward the city. I
          get up and raise my hand, too—not a wave, exactly, but close to it.
          Some other cars drive past. One of the drivers must think he knows me
          because he gives his horn a friendly little tap. I look both ways and
          then cross the street.
